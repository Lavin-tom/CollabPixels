# Inktober - Collaborative Pixel Art

Welcome to the **Inktober - Collaborative Pixel Art** project! This is a simple collaborative pixel art tool using Google Sheets designed for this season's Inktober challenge. Participants can create pixel art by updating the sheet daily based on provided reference values.

## Overview

- **Collaborative Platform**: This project utilizes Google Sheets, allowing anyone to contribute pixel art.
- **Daily Updates**: Reference values will be updated every day to inspire new creations.
- **Input Method**: Users can type or paste values directly into the cells to create pixel art.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Sheet**: Open the Google Sheets link provided in the main project page.
2. **Refer to the Daily Reference Values**: Each day, check the updated reference values to inspire your pixel art.
3. **Input Values**: Fill in the cells by typing or pasting the desired value. The default conditional formatting in Google Sheets will automatically create a visual representation based on the values you enter.
4. **Continuous Rows**: For a cohesive look, it’s recommended to fill pixels in continuous rows.
5. **Cell Value Accuracy**: Since multiple users can edit the sheet, ensure that your cell values exactly match the reference values to avoid any issues.
6. **No Sign-In Required**: You can fill in the pixels without needing to sign in to a Google account. 
7. **Artist Attribution**: If you contribute, please add your name (first name is enough) to the "Artists" page so we can recognize everyone involved in this collaborative artwork.

## Important Notes

- **Collaboration**: Be mindful that others are also contributing. Respect the existing artwork and try to work in areas that haven’t been filled yet.
- **Updates**: Remember that reference values will update weekly, so check back frequently for new inspiration.
- **Final Reveal**: The final image will be published on October 30, showcasing the collaborative effort, so the reference values will guide your contributions without displaying the complete final image until then.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to experiment within the guidelines! The goal is to create a vibrant piece of collaborative art together.
