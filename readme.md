Thank you all for valuable contribution.

## Overview

- **Collaborative Platform**: This project utilizes Google Sheets, allowing anyone to contribute pixel art.
- **Daily Updates**: Reference values will be updated every day to inspire new creations.
- **Input Method**: Users can type or paste values directly into the cells to create pixel art.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Sheet**: Open the Google Sheets link provided on the main project page.
2. **Refer to the Daily Reference Values**: Each day, check the updated reference values to inspire your pixel art.
3. **Input Values**: Fill in the cells by typing or pasting the desired value. The default conditional formatting in Google Sheets will automatically create a visual representation based on the values you enter.
4. **Continuous Rows**: For a cohesive look, it’s recommended to fill pixels in continuous rows.
5. **Cell Value Accuracy**: Since multiple users can edit the sheet, ensure that your cell values exactly match the reference values to avoid any issues.
6. **No Sign-In Required**: You can fill in the pixels without needing to sign in to a Google account.
7. **Artist Attribution**: If you contribute, please add your name (first name is enough) to the "Artists" page so we can recognize everyone involved in this collaborative artwork.

## Important Notes

- **Collaboration**: Be mindful that others are also contributing. Respect the existing artwork and try to work in areas that haven’t been filled yet.
- **Updates**: Remember that reference values will update daily, so check back frequently for new inspiration.
- **Final Image**: The final image will be set to 85 x 100, totaling 8,500 pixels. The first 24 days will have reference values in 3 rows, and the last 7 days will have 4 rows. This means you can add 255 pixels in the first 24 days and 340 pixels each day in the last week.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to copy as many values as you like, but please give others a chance to contribute as well. Ensure that copied values are placed in the same row and column as the reference, and make sure they match exactly.
- **Final Reveal**: The final image will be published on October 31, showcasing the collaborative effort, so the reference values will guide your contributions without displaying the complete final image until then.
- **Editing Limitations**: There is a limitation in this approach: you can only edit cells in the desktop version of Google Sheets. If you are trying to edit on mobile, please switch to the desktop version for editing. 
- **Pasting Values**: When pasting, use **Paste Special -> Values** instead of direct pasting. Direct pasting will copy the reference page's cell properties too. (This is optional; if you can't do this, please ignore it—I will correct it after your update.) If you do not use Paste Special with values alone, the sheet will not update with colors.

## Contribution

Your contributions are what make this project exciting! Whether you’re a seasoned pixel artist or just looking to try something new, everyone is welcome to join in. Let’s create a beautiful tapestry of pixel art together!
