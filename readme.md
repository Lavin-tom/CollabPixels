# Inktober - Collaborative Pixel Art

Welcome to the **Inktober - Collaborative Pixel Art** project! This is a flexible collaborative pixel art tool using Google Sheets designed for this season's Inktober challenge. Participants can freely create pixel art by updating the sheet daily, adding or modifying any values they desire based on their creativity and reference images. Feel free to add your own touch to the artwork

Many members have contributed to this project but some may have forgotten or are unwilling to add their names as contributors.
Thank you all for valuable contribution.

## Overview

- **Collaborative Platform**: This project utilizes Google Sheets, allowing anyone to contribute pixel art.
- **Daily Updates**: Reference values will be updated every day to inspire new creations.
- **Input Method**: Users can type or paste values directly into the cells to create pixel art.

## How to Use

1. **Access the Sheet**: Open the Google Sheets link provided on the main project page.
2. **Input Values**: You can enter any value in any of the 135 columns and 203 rows (a total of 27,405 cells available).
   - No need to copy reference values — simply type or paste the values you'd like to use, and the sheet will automatically adjust the color to match the desired format. The sheet will correct your input based on the reference values for that day.
3. **Continuous Rows**: For a cohesive look, it’s recommended to fill pixels in continuous rows.
4. **No Sign-In Required**: You can fill in the pixels without needing to sign in to a Google account.
5. **Artist Attribution**: If you contribute, please add your name (first name is enough) to the "Artists" page so we can recognize everyone involved in this collaborative artwork.

## Important Notes

- **Collaboration**: Be mindful that others are also contributing. Respect the existing artwork and try to work in areas that haven’t been filled yet.
- **Final Image**: The final image will be set to 135 x 205, totaling 27,405 pixels.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to add as many values as you like, but please give others a chance to contribute as well.
- **Final Reveal**: The final image will be published on October 31, showcasing the collaborative effort, so the reference values will guide your contributions without displaying the complete final image until then.
- **Editing Limitations**: There is a limitation in this approach: you can only edit cells in the desktop version of Google Sheets. If you are trying to edit on mobile, please switch to the desktop version for editing.

  ##New for This Year:

- **Input Flexibility**:
  - Unlike last year, you no longer need to copy reference values exactly. Instead, you can enter any values into the cells in any order. The sheet will automatically correct your input based on the daily reference values. This makes the process easier for everyone to contribute without having to worry about exact matches.

- **More Freedom**:
  - With 135 columns and 203 rows (a total of 27,405 cells available), you have more freedom to add your own creative input at any time. Whether you're adding a few pixels or contributing larger sections, you can fill in any part of the grid whenever you like.

## Contribution

Your contributions are what make this project exciting! Whether you’re a seasoned pixel artist or just looking to try something new, everyone is welcome to join in. Let’s create a beautiful tapestry of pixel art together!
